### Redundancy options

**Locally-redundant storage (LRS)**

- Least durable option
- 3 copies of data in the same data centre

**zone-redundant storage(ZRS)**

- 3 copies of data, each in a separate availability zone
- Data is copied in multiple data centre, so you are not affected if a problem occurs in a single data centre.

**Geo-redundant storage(GRS)**

- 3 copies of data in the same data centre using LRS, and then 3 LRS copies in a data centre in a region, that's far away from your primary region

**Geo zone redundant storage**

- 3 copies of data using ZRS. so copies in different availability zones and 3 copies of LRS in another data centre that's far away
